The following reflects my research into the 2011 Japan nuclear reactor disasters and the effect it will have on the American west coast.

Terms:

 *	Sv: sievert, the SI derived unit of dose equivalent
 *	mSv: millisievert, 1/1000 of a sievert
 *	μSv: microsievert, 1/1000 of a millisievert

Comparison chart:

 * Mammogram: 3 mSv
 * Brain CT scan: 0.8-5 mSv
 * Chest CT scan: 6-18 mSv
 * Gastrointestinal series X-ray investigation: 14 mSv
 * Chernobyl disaster shortly after explosion: 10,000-300,000 mSv/hour

Japanese reactor disasters:

 * Fukushima 1
   * Fukushima 1, March 15-16: 3-10 mSv/hour
   * Maximum recorded value at Fukushima 1, reactor 2: 8 mSv/hour, dropped to one-third this amount shortly after
   * Maximum recorded value at Fukushima 1, reactor 3: 1,000 mSv/hour briefly
   * Maximum recorded value at Fukushima 1: 400 mSv/hour, soon fell to 11.9 mSv/hour, 6 hours later fell to 0.6 mSv/hour
   * Maximum recorded value at the Fukushima 1 gate area: 11 mSv/hour briefly on March 16
 * Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant
   * 12:50 on March 13: 21 μSv/hour
   * 1:00 on March 13: 10 μSv/hour
   * 12 hours later: normal background levels
 
**Fallout Analysis**

From http://radiationfacts.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/radiation-from-japanese-nuclear-plants-will-reach-the-united-states-next-week-will-you-be-prepared/:

 > "The radiation released in Japan will start to flow towards the United States and will arrive on the west coast in areas such as California, Washington, Oregon by next week, approximately 7 days after the earthquake. The east coast such as Newpre York and Florida will be impacted a couple days after the west coast."

Acute whole-body dose of under 50 rem is typically subclinical and will produce nothing other than blood changes. 50 to 200 rem may cause illness but will rarely be fatal.

The following is my research on the predicted fallout pattern shown above:

To convert a quantity of absorbed dose (measured in rads) to a dose equivalent (measured in rems), we  consider the biological effects in man, and modify the calculation with a quality factor. For practical scenarios, 1 rad = 1 rem. So:

750 rads = 750 rems = 7.5 sV = 7500 mSv

Even the maximum recorded values for the Japanese power plant disasters come nowhere close to generating the amount of radiation required for the fallout prediction to be accurate, dispersal into the air and water notwithstanding. A human being located at the Fukushima 1 gate area during the maximum-recorded value on March 16 would absorb no more than 1.1 rads in an hour. Even using the absolute highest recorded value at Fukushima 1 of 1,000 mSv/hour results in 100 rads per hour at the site of the explosion.
